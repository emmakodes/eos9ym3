        "The model MRlogP",
        "is a neural network-based predictor designed for accurately estimating the lipophilicity (logP) of small druglike molecules.The primary objective of MRlogP is to improve logP prediction accuracy",
        "allowing for more informed decision-making in drug discovery."
